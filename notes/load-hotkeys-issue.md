When keyboard shortcuts view is opened, it should load the current keybindings and display them in the UI. However, it seems that the keybindings are not being loaded correctly, and the view is not full.

It happens when view is persist in the tabs, and app being reloaded. The view is not being updated with the current keybindings, leading to an empty or incomplete display.
