## Context
Two UX issues affect the visual keyboard and discovery flow:
- On Windows, bottom-row modifier positions are swapped: `Win` and `Alt` appear in each otherâ€™s positions. macOS bottom-row modifiers look and behave correctly.
- Hovering a hotkey in the commands list highlights the visual keyboard using the same color as active keys from the search bar, making it hard to distinguish hover-induced highlights from search-active highlights.

Definition of done:
- Windows bottom-row modifiers (`Win`, `Alt`) render in correct positions and respond properly for highlights/weights.
- Hover highlights use a distinct visual style from search-active keys so both can be understood at a glance.

## Decisions
- [2025-08-09] Track this as a focused visual/UX fix before next build.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Correct Windows bottom-row mapping for `Win` and `Alt` in keyboard layout/config.
- [ ] Differentiate hover highlight vs search-active highlight (color or border style), ensure accessible contrast in light/dark.
- [ ] Sanity-check macOS/Linux layouts unaffected by change.
- [ ] Verify with keyboard listener on/off and with heatmap scope toggles.
- [ ] Update screenshots/notes after validation in test-vault.
