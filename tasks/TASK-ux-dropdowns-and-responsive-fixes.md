## Context
Follow-up polish after the Filter/View/Menu split: dropdowns did not close on a second click, active states for View/Modules were inconsistent, spacing needed adjustment, the clear icon looked like a plus, the featured star looked too button-like, and in small panes the keyboard overflowed its background and pushed a horizontal scroll on the whole view.

## Decisions
- [2025-08-09] Dropdown close: Attach `use:clickOutside` to `.menu-anchor` wrapper so the toggle button counts as inside; second click now closes. Also close other menus when one opens.
- [2025-08-09] Active states/spacing: Mirror Filter button active styling for View/Modules; add margins between buttons and the summary.
- [2025-08-09] Clear icon: Replace with lucide `X` to visually read as close, not plus.
- [2025-08-09] Featured star: Revert from a `<button>` to a non-button div to reduce visual weight.
- [2025-08-09] Responsive keyboard: Remove `min-width: 100%` override for `.xs/.sm #keyboard-layout`; enable `overflow-x: auto` on `#keyboard-preview-view`; hide horizontal scroll on the outer view container.

## Changes
- `src/components/SearchMenu.svelte`: Move `use:clickOutside` to the three `.menu-anchor` wrappers; ensure second-click closes; swap clear icon to `<X />`.
- `src/components/CommandsList.svelte`: Revert featured star to `.star-icon` div with onclick.
- `src/styles.css`: Active state rules for `#hotkey-view-button` and `#hotkey-modules-button`; spacing between controls and summary; responsive keyboard container scroll adjustments.
- `src/views/ShortcutsView.ts`: Set `contentEl.style.overflowX = 'hidden'` to prevent whole-view horizontal scroll.

## Verification
- Built with `vite build --mode production`; output emitted to `../obsidian-keyboard-analyzer-dev/` successfully.
- Manual: Second-click on View/Modules closes; Filter unchanged. In narrow panes, keyboard background stays intact; horizontal scroll appears within keyboard area only.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Sanity-check behavior on mobile-sized panes and iPad widths.
- [ ] Optional: center keyboard when there is no overflow, while keeping inner scroll when needed.
- [ ] Optional: add focus trap to dropdowns if keyboard navigation is desired.
