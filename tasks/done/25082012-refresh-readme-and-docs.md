## Context

We are approaching a new release and need clear, concise, and up‑to‑date documentation. Scope: make README detailed and user‑focused; keep docs/ slim (2–3 end‑user pages); update install for official listing.

## Decisions

- [2025-08-20] README should be richer for end users; extra technical docs removed.
- [2025-08-20] Keep only Installation, Usage, Troubleshooting in docs/.

## Next Steps

- [x] Update README with detailed end‑user information and links (agent)
- [x] Update Installation for official Community Plugins listing (agent)
- [x] Merge system defaults info into Usage; trim docs/ to Installation, Usage, Troubleshooting (agent)
- [x] Add CHANGELOG.md and note documentation changes (agent)

## Progress Log
- [2025-08-20 12:55 UTC] Created task and refreshed README; added docs pages (index, installation, usage, development, release, architecture, troubleshooting); aligned wording in `docs/system-shortcuts.md`.
- [2025-08-20 13:15 UTC] Rewrote README with detailed end‑user focus; updated installation for official listing; consolidated docs to 3 user pages; removed extra docs; added CHANGELOG.md.
