# Troubleshooting

Plugin not visible
- Ensure files are in `[Vault]/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-keyboard-analyzer/`
- Reload plugins or restart Obsidian

Dev build not updating
- Confirm outDir: `../obsidian-keyboard-analyzer-dev`
- Use `npm run dev` (watch) or rerun `npm run build`

macOS modifiers look odd
- Symbols/labels differ by OS; report issues with screenshots and OS version

No results or missing commands
- Check scope filters and “Include system defaults” toggle

Still stuck?
- Open an issue with steps, OS, Obsidian version, and screenshots
