## About

With this plugin you will be able to:

- see and analyze all your assigned hotkeys in Obsidian on visual keyboard
  layout
- search by key combination
- see custom hotkeys
- see duplicate hotkeys
- highlight featured hotkeys

## How to use

1. To open plugin you can click on keyboard icon in status bar (to open in a new
   pane use `Ctrl + Click`)
2. To open plugin run command `Keyboard Analyzer: Open Shortcuts View`

The plugin is poorly tested on operating systems other than Windows, I would be
grateful for any help with testing support.

## Custom Keyboard Layouts

This plugin uses a unified keyboard layout defined in the code. While it's not possible to provide a custom layout file yet, you can modify the existing layout if you are comfortable with editing the plugin's code.

The layout is defined in `src/Constants.ts` in the `UNIFIED_KEYBOARD_LAYOUT` object.

### OS-Specific Key Configuration

To handle differences between operating systems, you can provide OS-specific configurations for each key using the `os` property. This is useful for keys like `Ctrl`, `Alt`, `Win`, and `Cmd`.

Here is an example for the "Win" key (or "Command" key on macOS):

```typescript
{
  label: 'Meta',
  code: 'MetaLeft',
  os: {
    macos: { modifier: 'Meta', unicode: '‚åò', label: 'Meta' },
    windows: { modifier: undefined, unicode: 'Win', label: 'Win' },
    linux: { modifier: undefined, unicode: 'Win', label: 'Win' },
  },
}
```

- `label`: The text displayed on the key.
- `code`: The `KeyboardEvent.code` value for the key. This is important for matching hotkeys.
- `unicode`: A character to display on the key, often a symbol.
- `modifier`: The modifier role of the key (`'Control'`, `'Alt'`, `'Shift'`, `'Meta'`). If `undefined`, the key is not treated as a modifier for hotkey searches.

For a comprehensive list of key codes, you can refer to this [Key Code Reference Table](https://www.toptal.com/developers/keycode).

## Installation

As plugin is not yet published in community plugins library, you will need to install it manually or with
help of [BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat) plugin for beta
testing.

P.S. This is my first public code in my life - would be happy to get feedback or
a donation which will help me to continue creating this and other plugins for
obsidian.
